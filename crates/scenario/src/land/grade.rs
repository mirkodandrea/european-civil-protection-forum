//! Road grading: the ground under every road is a flat bench, its long
//! profile smoothed, with cut and fill slopes back to the natural ground.
//!
//! The published render DEM knows nothing of the roads: a 9.6 m carriageway
//! painted on a 30° hillside leaned across with it. This is the one rule that
//! levels it, applied as a function of position over the raw heightfield, so
//! every consumer of [`super::Terrain::height_at`] — the terrain mesh, the
//! engines, the houses, the plants, the agents' slopes — sees the same ground.
//!
//! The rule:
//! - each road is resampled every ≤ 5 m, and its centreline height is the raw
//!   ground smoothed *along the network* (a diffusion over the graph of
//!   resampled points, so two roads meeting at a junction meet at one height);
//! - across the road the ground is level out to the road's half-width plus a
//!   shoulder ([`flat_half_width`]);
//! - beyond, it returns to the raw ground over a width that grows with the cut
//!   or fill (slopes of about 37°, up to [`MAX_BLEND_M`]);
//! - where several roads are near, the nearest dominates.
//!
//! Ported from `propagator_abm` (`scenario::grade`). `TTX_GRADE_ROADS=0`
//! switches it off (the raw DEM, for comparisons).
