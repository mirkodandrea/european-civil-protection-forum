//! The vegetation: where it grows (`scatter`), how it is drawn (`render`),
//! and how the fire reaches it (here).
//!
//! Rewritten from scratch on 2026-11-01 to run the same on the desktop and on
//! an iPhone (WebGL2 in iOS WebKit), with the practices of vegetation
//! rendering:
//!
//! - **Instancing.** Each variety has one mesh per level of detail
//!   (`meshes`), every plant is an instance of it: a static record of 32
//!   bytes (where, yaw, size, tint, its own random numbers), uploaded once.
//! - **Nothing is rebuilt.** Meshes, instance buffers, the atlas and the bind
//!   group are made once per scene; per frame the GPU receives 48 bytes of
//!   uniforms, and 8 bytes per plant of a group whose fire state changed.
//!   No Bevy `Mesh`, `Material` or `Image` asset is created or modified.
//! - **Tiles, culling, LOD per view.** On the desktop the island is cut in
//!   1280 m tiles: each view (camera and shadow cascades) draws only the
//!   tiles in its frustum, the authored models near the camera, proxies
//!   beyond, a cheaper crown far away (`render`). The browser draws the
//!   island as one tile of proxies: a few dozen draws.
//! - **Shading made for foliage.** Wrapped diffuse, light through the leaves
//!   against the sun, sky and ground ambient, occlusion toward the heart of
//!   the crown, the sun's shadows; no full PBR (`shaders/plants.wesl`).
//!   Leaf cards are cut out of the atlas (alpha to coverage with MSAA) only
//!   where they are drawn, on the desktop; the proxies are opaque, and a
//!   `discard` never runs in their pass (tile-based GPUs keep their
//!   hidden-surface removal).
//!
//! **Fire.** For each plant the CPU decides one number, the instant it
//! catches ([`plant_fire`]): the interpolated arrival of the fire at its
//! foot (as `field::FireField::arrival`, so a stand catches as a wave rather
//! than as a 20 m block) plus its own lag, and whether a crew cut it. Once a
//! plant has caught it stays caught. The shader works out the rest from the
//! simulated clock: scorch, the glowing front crawling through the crown,
//! embers, charcoal, the crown gone and the remains uncovered.
