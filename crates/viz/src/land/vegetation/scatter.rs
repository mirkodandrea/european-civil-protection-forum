//! incident did.
//!
//! The fuel raster is the only vegetation source this scenario has — there is
//! no tree inventory, and there never will be one at 10 km scale. The terrain
//! under the plants is bare ground (see [`crate::land::terrain_mesh`]), so the land
//! cover a player sees is geometry: macchia as much as trees (the meadow
//! tufts are the terrain shader's). The visual density comes from crown width
//! and overlap rather than from stem count, because a hundred wide crowns
//! close a canopy that a thousand narrow ones would not.
