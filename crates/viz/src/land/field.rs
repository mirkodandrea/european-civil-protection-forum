//! Reading the fire as a continuous field instead of as 20 m cells.
//!
//! The CA computes on a 20 m raster, but nothing says the fire has to be
//! *drawn* on one — and if it is, the result looks like a spreadsheet: square
//! flame fronts, staircase scar edges, whole blocks of trees igniting in
//! lockstep. The renderers on the CPU sample the fire through this module
//! instead, which bilinearly interpolates the cell fields; the scar on the
//! ground does the same in the terrain's shader, from the fire map
//! (`fire_view::update_fire_map`, `shaders/fire_ground.wesl`), with the sample
//! warped by ~7 m of value noise so the boundary meanders at a scale finer
//! than the grid it came from.
//!
//! This is a rendering device and nothing more: the model is unchanged, and no
//! decision — exposure, intervention, agent behaviour — is ever taken from
//! these interpolated values.
