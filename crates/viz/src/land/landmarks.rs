//! The island's landmarks: the rocca on the summit and the stone tower on the
//! headland, from their Blender models (`scripts/build_island_models.py`).
//!
//! Where they stand is the factory's decision, not the game's
//! (`tools/factory/island.py` picks the summit and the headland, levels the
//! ground, takes the fuel off it and writes `island.json`): this only draws what
//! the data says. They are scenery: the fire never sees them, and they are
//! drawn at true scale (the data's `scale` is the source's diorama size).
