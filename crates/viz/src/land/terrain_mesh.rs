//! Building the terrain mesh from the 5 m render heightfield.
//!
//! The full field is 2048² = 4.19 M vertices, which is far too much for one
//! mesh: it defeats frustum culling and blows past the 16-bit index limit. It
//! is split into chunks instead, each its own entity, so the renderer can cull
//! and the driver gets sensibly sized buffers.
//!
//! The ground colour and the normal are not vertex attributes but two
//! textures, one texel per base sample (`shaders/terrain.wgsl` reads them), so the picture does not depend on how dense the mesh is. That
//! lets every chunk be meshed at three levels (base stride x1, x2, x4: 32 k,
//! 8 k and 2 k triangles) and drawn by distance with a [`VisibilityRange`]
//! (abrupt: the terrain shader does not dither). Each level has a skirt
//! to hide the cracks between chunks at different levels. A ranged entity is
//! never a shadow caster, so the shadows come from one extra entity per chunk
//! on [`SHADOW_LAYER`] (the sun's layer, not the camera's), sharing the x2 mesh.
//!
//! The terrain is **ground**, not vegetation. It used to be painted with the
//! fuel raster's classes, which read as a camouflage patchwork however much
//! the boundaries were warped — the underlying data is 20 m and no amount of
//! colour dithering hides that. Vegetation is now drawn as actual plants (see
//! [`crate::land::vegetation`]), and this layer paints only what is under them:
//! soil, rock on the steep faces, sand at the shore, sea below the waterline.
//! Along the coast the ground has two materials of its own ([`coast_rock`],
//! [`coast_sand`]): banded limestone on the cliffs, rippled sand on the beaches.
//! Ground colour therefore varies with slope, elevation and noise — geology,
//! not land cover — which is both honest and far better looking.
