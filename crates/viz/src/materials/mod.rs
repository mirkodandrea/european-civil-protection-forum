//! The scenery's materials, one type per kind of surface.
//!
//! - [`TerrainMaterial`]: the ground, its roads and meadows (`terrain.wgsl`).
//! - [`FoliageMaterial`]: the vegetation, and its fire (`foliage.wgsl`, with
//!   the vertex stages `veg_vertex.wgsl` / `veg_prepass.wgsl`).
//! - [`StructureMaterial`]: buildings, landmarks, boats, rocks and the units:
//!   StandardMaterial plus a procedural [`Finish`] and a PBR response per part
//!   (`surface_alpha`, baked per vertex) (`structure.wgsl`).
//! - Everything else (pins, rings, jets, fields) is a plain `StandardMaterial`.
//!
//! All of them are lit by Bevy's PBR (`apply_pbr_lighting`) and fogged by it.
//! Terrain and foliage are materials of their own rather than extensions of
//! StandardMaterial because of WebGL2: it has 16 texture units per stage, and
//! every texture in a pipeline's layout takes one whether the shader reads it or
//! not. StandardMaterial's six would leave the terrain no room for its four.
//! The shared surface functions are in `scenery.wgsl` (`rocca::scenery`).
